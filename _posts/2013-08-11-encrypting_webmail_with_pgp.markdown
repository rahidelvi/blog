When the Edward Snowden story about mass surveillance programs undertaken by the United States and other governments broke, the topic of privacy and information security was 'trending'.

My interest in the story relates to Glenn Greenwald and his use of PGP encryption to communicate securely with Edward Snowden.PGP encryption has been around for sometime now.

But if the use of PGP encryption isn't mainstream, it's probably because  the available documentation can appear slightly intimidating to new users. Fortunately, for the most part, it's pretty easy to use.

So, if you're curious to try it out, and possibly adopt, PGP encryption for some of your sensitive email communications, you might find the video below helpful.

There are many ways to go about encrypting data using PGP, however, the video focuses on these starting ingredients:

- You use a webmail service like Gmail or Yahoo! Mail (or others like it)
- You have Google Chrome installed on your computer
- You are using Windows

One last note for this post. Though PGP encryption is considered to be among the strongest we have available today, it may not hold up to the computing power available for cryptanalysis  tomorrow. Therefore, claims of PGP being impenetrable should be approached with some caution. Today, it's pretty good!
