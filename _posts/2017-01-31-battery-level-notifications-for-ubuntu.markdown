Subhan'allah! [Thank you dear God][ðŸŒ¦]. We are to You, [and to You we are returning][wolf]. This bit was updated "this day", as Claire waaah ðŸ˜¢, almost used to say.

Formerly gregorian, it was `date: '2017-01-31 02:05:37'` or `170131` or _Jan 31, 2017_.

The power manager on your laptop does an *okay* job letting you know when it needs charging. But it never tells you if itâ€™s been plugged in for too long. The solution? A script that notifies you when it's time to either plug in or unplug your battery charger.

[Jump to the script][5].

#### Context

My laptop gets a pretty serious workout almost everyday at GrantBook, my wonderful BYOD workplace. I upgraded to a new laptop in October 2014 and by October 2016 it could barely hold a charge. Part of the problem was my battery overheated often (too many applications running), but it was also almost always plugged in. Itâ€™s super easy to forget about your battery when youâ€™re immersed in interesting work.

I had my laptop battery replaced in October 2016, and this time I'm hoping to do a better of maintaining it.

#### Research

If youâ€™ve done [some reading on the topic][1], you would have learnt that apart from keeping your battery cool, itâ€™s also a good idea to keep it charged somewhere in the range of 40% to 80%. Thatâ€™s supposed to be optimal. And, about once a month, it helps to discharge the battery completely.

That once a month deep discharge task is easy to remember. A recurring event in your calendar should do the job. But what about keeping your battery charged in that 40% to 80% range?

Fortunately, *KasiyA* over on Ask Ubuntu [shared a script][2] that lets you know when your battery reaches an upper or lower threshold (that you get to set).

#### Solution

Now when my laptop batteryâ€™s charge reaches 80%, I get this notification.

![Upper Limit Notification][3]

And when it drops below 40%, I see this.

![Lower Limit Notification][4]

If for some reason I miss or ignore the notification, the script puts my screen to sleep. Itâ€™s not as horrible as it sounds. It only takes a second to unlock my screen and get back to what I was doing.

##### The Script

![Subhan'allah, dear Allah..., you are lovely](https://i.imgur.com/HnHolx6.jpg)

Hereâ€™s my slightly modified version of the script. It runs when my computer starts.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

## Tutorial on battery level notifications (askubuntu.com/a/518955/60869)

    while true
    do
        export DISPLAY=:0.0
        battery_level=`acpi -b | grep -P -o '[0-9]+(?=%)'`
        if on_ac_power; then
            if [ $battery_level -ge 80 ]; then
                notify-send "Rahi, you can unplug the AC adapter. The battery is charging above 80%." "Charging: ${battery_level}% "
                sleep 40
                if on_ac_power; then
                    gnome-screensaver-command -l   ## lock the screen if you don't unplug AC adapter after 40 seconds
                fi
             fi
        else
             if [ $battery_level -le 40 ]; then
                notify-send "Rahi, time to plug in the AC adapter! Battery charge is lower than 40%." "Charging: ${battery_level}%"
                sleep 40
                if ! on_ac_power; then
                    gnome-screensaver-command -l   ## lock the screen if you don't plug AC adapter after 40 seconds
                fi
             fi
        fi

        sleep 300 # 300 seconds or 5 minutes
    done
```

Although I've been diligently adhering to the notifications it's still a little early to tell if it's making a difference. Iâ€™ll have to write a follow up post one day and let you know how this experiment went.

The battery heat issue is still not an easy problem to solve. I think it would require a major change in my current work habits. As for the problem of a perpetually plugged in laptop, I think I'm quite happy with the notifications approach to keeping it properly charged.

Do you have a battery maintenance strategy?
