I was [admitted to CAMH](https://photos.app.goo.gl/JnmuYYTGSz45GSqNA) twice in 2019. Both _episodes_ for me question the validity of the "nanny state", and being a "ward of the state". This is a question that should trouble left-libertarians across the spectrum.

CAMH is a _pure_ bureaucracy.

The plastic cups in which you are served your medication is promptly **discarded**, after 3 seconds of use. Is that justified? I wonder what Elizabeth May would have to say about this policy.

I met with a social worker on the ward today. I was more than a pleasant conversation. Why? The social worker was receptive to my feedback. My feedback was steeped in start-up culture of rolling up your sleeves and getting down to work.

**What did I suggest?** The topic I've been discussing with the social worker had to do with housing. The _topic of housing_ is of great interest to virtually anyone who is admitted to the psychiatric wards in Canada. There is peril that is palpable.

My conversation went from being offered _shelters for substance abuse survivors_ **to** discussing curriculum for patients regarding how to use _Kijiji_ to vett scam offers, and how to reach out to resources that the City of Toronto might have to report fiscal crimes.

It was a productive conversation.

**The takeaway?** Start-up culture teaches you how to work within constraints. The chief constraint at **CAMH**, or the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health is one of grotesque bureaucracy. The edges, front-line staff, have next to 0 input in using their discretion. Virtually everything is dictated, literally in some cases, from _the top_. There's very little room from bottom-up feedback. My productive conversation with the social worker was an example of **innovation under austerity**.
