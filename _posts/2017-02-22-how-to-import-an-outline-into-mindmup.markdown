[MindMup][2] is my mind mapping tool of choice.

While itâ€™s not as pretty as other options on the market, it more than compensates in function and usability. Itâ€™s minimal, super responsive and comes with a neat set of keyboard shortcuts. Build in a little muscle memory and youâ€™ll be manipulating ideas on the canvas with no effort. And if youâ€™re using MindMup with Google Drive, itâ€™s free, including real time collaboration capabilities.

Sometimes I realize the best tool for the job is a mind map after I've started an outline somewhere else like on a word processor or a slide deck. Sometimes my fellow collaborator started their outline outside a mind map. So how do you bring these kinds of outlines into MindMup?

~~There isn't a convenient way.~~

*Update Sep 2, 2018*

Thankfully MindMup now makes it _ridiculously easy_ to import outlines into the tool. Follow these links to see the [feature request update][13] and a [demo of the new feature][14]. You can safely ignore the rest of the post below ðŸ˜ƒ.

Phew, that seems like a lot. I know.

Ideally you pick the right tool for the task early in your creative process. But if you don't, with a little bit of practice, you can learn how to pull off these steps in just a few minutes. I hope in the future MindMup developers provide users easier options of importing data into to the tool.
