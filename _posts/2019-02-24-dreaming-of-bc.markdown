Contrary to _who_ some might believe, _for all intents and purposes_, my 2019 has been off to a tremendous start. I am grateful.

More than anything my 2019 gave me time. Time for reflection. To be myself again, after many many years. I hope I didn't and don't squander it on browsing the world wide web.

Indeed, I want to get-outside. To read. To learn. To play. To watch. To eat. To live. To breathe.

> I can think of no better place for myself other than **#Squamish**.

Yep.

### Why the Squamish fixation?

Simple.

I _saw_ the treetops ðŸŒ² of Squamish, equipped with virtually (aka nearly) nothing but a radio tower and what I might have been wearing, in my dream.

Say again?

**Where did I see this?** In a dream. Those personalized screenings at night.

**When?** Before I physically visited Squamish, BC when Claire was about year and a half.

![BC calling...][1]

So that's part of my 2019 hopes. Stitch together enough dollars to take care of home duties and well..., personal interests.
