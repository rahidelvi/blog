# Know that

üî≠ üî¨

> **‚òùÔ∏è| A leaf üçÇ a pine needle is the prefix of the following ÿßŸÑŸÖ**

### [49:12]

O you who believe, you shall greatly avoid suspicion-some suspicion is sinful. And do not spy on one another, nor shall you backbite. Would any of you enjoy eating the flesh of his dead brother? You certainly would hate this. You shall observe God. God is Redeemer, Merciful.

Kindly consider the unjustified surveillance scourge hijacking the #fuad of #rijjaaaal and #nisaa on the world wide web

It will end eventually according to the warnings in the #quraaaaan #furqaaaan

Essentially, the plain and ludicrously conspicuous command from the owner of the üåå milky way among other artifacts is the following ‚§µÔ∏è

> - Tell the **‚Äúbelieving"**

>    - INDIVIDUALS

that  ü§î   ‚ÅâÔ∏è

# spying is [ strongly discouraged ] in a remarkable #ayat

which is worth mentioning again to drive the point home ‚§µÔ∏è

> O you who believe, you shall greatly avoid suspicion-some suspicion is sinful. And do not spy on one another, nor shall you backbite. Would any of you enjoy eating the flesh of his dead brother? You certainly would hate this. You shall observe God. God is Redeemer, Merciful.

# The üì∫ Movie Review üçø

Citizenfour expects everyone to know why it's so important.

You feel it, but you'd be hard pressed to find visuals or explanations that elaborate on the significance of Edward Snowden's actions.

The focus instead is on Snowden and the days leading up to the big event: blowing the whistle on the US government's surveillance activities.

Yes, blowing the whistle was and *is* a big deal.

But the movie also feels like a missed opportunity.

I'd loved to have seen it tackle topics related to civic engagement and what it means to live in a modern democracy. And, the question of liberty, why is it so important to preserve? It touches on these and other topics, yet fails to delve meaningfully into any one of them.

I left thinking that Snowden is a pretty grounded individual and that the journalists working with him were doing a good job.

Overall, Citizenfour preaches to the converted, leaves us with the sense that we're being watched and offers *no alternative*. If you‚Äôre wondering what exactly happened when **#Snowden** was trending on twitter, this is the documentary for you.
