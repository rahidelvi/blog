Life is stunning.

I learned today that God _wants to blow our minds_. A brother [was saying](https://youtu.be/LP3eNNLOs-M?t=1102).

I'm paraphrasing...

> - Hydrogen is flammable
> - Oxygen if introduced to "lit" hydrogen will actually make the fire worse
> - And water ðŸŒ¦ðŸ’§â˜”, is exactly that

`Al'hamdulilah`: _the sum of all praises belongs with **the** God_. Plus lots more.

Peace.

Oh, there's a racism thing I'm working on. Have a few minutes to spare? I could [use your input](https://i.rahidelvi.ca/need-input-from-black-parents-dealing-with-tdsb-racism).
