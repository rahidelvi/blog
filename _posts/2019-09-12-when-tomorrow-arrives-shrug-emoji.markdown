Life is stunning.

I learned today that God _wants to blow our minds_. A brother was saying.

I'm paraphrasing...

> - Hydrogen is flammable
> - Oxygen if introduced to a "lit" hydrogen would make the fire worse
> - And water ðŸŒ¦ðŸ’§â˜”, is exactly that

`Al'hamdulilah`: _the sum of all praises belongs with **the** God_. Plus lots more.

Peace.
