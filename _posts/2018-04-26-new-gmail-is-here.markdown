I love the new Gmail. I am especially glad Google didn't get rid of _Multiple Inboxes_ and the awesome keyboard shortcuts.

I do like the whitespace implementation of Inbox by Gmail better but the other cool stuff is now in Gmail. Namely, hover actions, snoozing emails, quick reply and a better UI in some respects (not being able to hide the nav menu on the left for example was a pet peeve of mine).

The bonus features are the calendar and keep integrations. Those are pretty cool. Tasks are what they always were, but the improved UI is nice.

After having _Inbox by Gmail_ as my daily driver on both desktop and mobile for a long time now I'm tempted to switch.
