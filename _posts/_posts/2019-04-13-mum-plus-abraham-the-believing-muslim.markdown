English Translations on Abraham, who was a Muslim according to the Cherisher's word in the Quran.

### The hunch

- Jamie Kennedy in a YouTube video about his rules for success in life led me to learn a bit more about Johnny Carson
- I trust Jamie Kennedy from what I've observed, he seems _like nice guy_ (you've got to say that with Russell Peter's accent)
- That led me to this video of a person who reminds me of my mother Vidyavathi Shastry-Delvi

Look at this gal's posture eh?

Anyway, this whole thing brought me to consider Abraham's words, according to God, no less, from the Quran.

### Plain Translations

[On a Facebook Post][1]

> When his Lord said to him, "Submit (i.e. surrender all your wills to Allah as a Muslim)!" He (Abraham) said, "I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of the 'Alameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)."

Beautiful and plain translation.

[From Sacred-Texts][2]

> Behold! his Lord said
> To him: "Bow (thy will to Me):"
> He said: "I bow (my will)
> To the Lord and Cherisher
> Of the Universe."

Look how beautiful this tranlation is. Notice the word _Bow_. One version of the bow, is to essentially _take the high road_, ie, go against the path of _least resistance_.

In other words, _don't mindlessly go with the flow_, like an automaton, but rather try and be deliberate about how you orient and deploy your God given will.

You know?

Alright, nuff of that.

Here's the other really AMAZING interpretation of the word Bow.

- Arc
- Salaat (literally stand, bow your body, and prostrate)
  - Also see [Salaat resource][3] from the Free Minds public forum about recommendations on how to perform Salaat
- This is fun-ish, scary-ish, mystical-ish = hunting. Bow and arrow üèπ

Finally, if you must be _inflexible_ for whatever reason (and there are plenty of reasons, such as saying **NO** to something that doesn't feel right, then _[be good about it][4]_.

Allah'hu'Akbar. Indeed.
