So, my wake up call was basically on Dec 3, 2018. The contents were as follows.

### Al-Asr

> |وَالْعَصْرِ‌

- By **Time**.

> إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ‌

- Man is indeed in loss.

> إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ‌‌

- Except those who `believe`,
- and `do good works`,
- and `support one another with the truth`,
- and `support one another with` _`ṣabr`_

`believe` (2:177)

- Piety _is not_ to turn your faces towards the east and the west,

- but pious is one who **believes**
    - in `God` and `the Last Day`,
    - and `the angels`,
    - and `the Book`,
    - and `the prophets`,

- and he **gives money out of love**
    - to `the relatives`,
    - and `the orphans`,
    - and `the needy`,
    - and `the wayfarer`,
    - and `those who ask`,
    - and `to free the slaves`;

- and he **carries out the communion**,
- and _contributes towards purification_;

- and `those who keep their pledges when they make a pledge`,
- and `those who are patient in the face of adversity and hardship and when in despair`.

- These are the ones who have been truthful, and these are the righteous.


`ṣabr`

- patience in face of all unexpected and unwanted outcomes
- perseverance _and_ persistence
- endurance
