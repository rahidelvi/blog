## Blog (WIP)

Website based on a [lighter version](https://github.com/rahidelvi/G14) of [jasper2](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2)

This is a full-featured port of Ghost's default theme from [FÃ¡bio Madeira](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2). See  [Casper](https://github.com/tryghost/casper)
*v2.1.7* for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) / [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Features

* Full author information including: picture, bio, website, twitter, linkedin, etc.
* Tag description(s) and personalised covers (via `_data/tags.yml`)
* Related posts view at the bottom of each post
* All Ghost default pages: Author page(s), Tag page(s), About page(s), 404, etc.
* Pagination (infinite scrolling or standard pagination, i.e. posts across multiple pages)
* Atom Feeds by [Jekyll-feed](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed)
* Toggleable subscribe button (requires an external service)
* Code Syntax Highlight with [prism.js](http://prismjs.com/)
* Support for Google Analytics tracking
* Support for Disqus comments (not Ghost standard)


## Getting Started

### Deployment

**Important:**  For security reasons, Github does not allow plugins (under `_plugins/`) when
deploying with Github Pages. This means:

- we need to generate your site locally (more details below) and push the resulting HTML (the contents of `_site/`) to a Github repository, that GitHub Pages then host;


- for this option simply clone this repository (*master branch*), and then run
`bundle exec jekyll serve` inside the directory. Upload the resulting `_site/` contents to your repository (*master branch* if uploading as your personal page
(e.g. username.github.io) or *gh-pages branch* if uploading as a project page
(as for the [demo](https://github.com/myJekyll/jasper2/tree/gh-pages)).


### Author Pages

In order to properly generate author pages you need to rename the field *author* in the
front matter of every post to match that of your each author's *username* as defined
in the *[\_data/authors.yml](_data/authors.yml)* file.
With the latest update, multiple author blogs are now supported out of the box.

### Compiling Styles

Following on the way Casper styles are compiled as [described here](https://github.com/tryghost/casper#development):

Jasper2 styles are compiled using Gulp/PostCSS to polyfill future CSS spec. You'll need Node and Gulp installed globally. After that, from the theme's root directory:

```bash
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

Now you can edit `/assets/css/` files, which will be compiled to `/assets/built/` automatically.

## Thanks


Many thanks to the Ghost team for all the design work. Also many thanks to all contributors,
that help keeping the project alive and updated :smile:
